# EMF 2024 dome

AKA the "75%" dome

## What is it

All the parts required to cut hubs for a 2V dome out of 6mm MDF.

## What to Cut

For a 2V dome:

| Part  | Count |
| 5-way hubs   | 6        |
| 6-way hubs   | 10       |
| 4-way hubs   | 10       |
| A-connectors | 60       |
| B-connectors | 70       |


## How to assemble:

- source 65 pieces of 40mm tubing
- line up each tube with the bend in the connector pieces
- drill the two holes, the bolts are 8mm so try to drill close to that
- using a dome calculator calculate the tube lengths, there are two lengths, "A" and "B". "A" is the shorter of the tubes
- assemble the hubs first, slotting in the correct connector parts. Bolt through each of the holes making sure not to overtighten
- bolt tubes into the connectors
